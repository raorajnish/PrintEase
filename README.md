# PrintEase

PrintEase is an online document printing service where users can upload multiple PDF and DOCX files, customize their print preferences, and proceed to checkout. The system automatically calculates the total price based on the number of pages and print type (Black & White or Color). Orders and payments are managed within the platform.

## Features

- **Upload Multiple Documents:** Accepts PDFs and DOCX files.
- **Automatic Page Count Detection:** Extracts page numbers from the uploaded file.
- **Custom Page Selection:** Validates and allows users to print specific pages.
- **Dynamic Price Calculation:** Based on print type (B&W or Color) and total pages.
- **Order Management:** Associates print files with orders linked to users.
- **Payment Integration:** Uses Razorpay for payments.
- **Admin Panel:** Manage orders and update statuses (Pending, Confirmed, Ready to Take, Cancelled).

## API Endpoints
